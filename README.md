# Basic Math Calculator

## Overview:

The Basic Math Calculator is a Java-based console application that provides a straightforward way to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This tool allows users to input two numbers, select an operation, and view the formatted result.

## Features:

Intuitive Menu Interface: Users can choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using a simple menu system.
Error Handling: The calculator checks for division by zero and alerts the user if division is undefined.
Formatted Output: Results are formatted with commas to improve readability for larger numbers.
Continuous Calculation Option: The program runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

## How to Use:

Launch the Program: The program starts by displaying an introduction and the main menu.
Select an Operation: Enter the number corresponding to the desired operation:
1 for Addition
2 for Subtraction
3 for Multiplication
4 for Division
5 to Exit

## Enter Numbers: 

For each operation, you will be prompted to enter two numbers.

View Results: 

After performing the operation, the formatted result is displayed on the screen.

Repeat or Exit: 

You may perform another operation or choose to exit the program.
